# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 4

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? implementing the cursor with linked lists rather than the array of arrays

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? i know how to use lists and how they can be added to and removed to, i need to know how to implement what i know using the linked list and the iterators, as well as how the cursor works in this scenario

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? tke it step by step, first start with the invariant and work from there

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? my mind, ive done the last few assignments and even if they werent done completely im starting to understand how this all works.

What are some new skills I will need to develop? how to implement this into what i want to do, this isnt the same as the last assignment so i will need to do it with the parameters and requirements for this assignment

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? just take it slow and ask for help when needed

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part? invariant, i will get that done and then work on the dynamic raster test

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties? i worked on them to the best of my abilities, there are some problems i just couldnt fix myself

How did the plan go? it went fairly well, i was at tutoring so i benefited when there

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment? maybe try to get it done as soon as i can, and work on my own first and then see if i need any help

Do I need more resources? i feel like yes, i feel like if there were resources i could use during the weekend such as tutors etc, i wouldnt be as lazy with the assignment
