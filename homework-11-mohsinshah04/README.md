# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 11

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Monday 10pm (with the whole homework due to Thanksgiving)

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? this assignment, getting an overview is about hashing, in this case we are using bucket hashing, in this homework, we will utilize a well-known hash of contents (CRC-32) to create a hash table using URIâ€™s as keys.

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? i know how to implement a hash as we used it in the last assignment and have the methods needed such as contains and add. what i need to know is how to use bucket-Hashing and utilizing CRC-32 also just learning new implementation that are used in this assignment that werent used previously.

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? take it step by step, dont rush it and ask for help when needed. also look into the resources provided and understand those before i go into the assignments methods

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? i learn well with resources so i will use that strength wisely, i also am good at asking questions so i will be attending office hours to ask for help when i get stuck.

What are some new skills I will need to develop? new skills i will need to develop are my critical thinking skills, i need to better myself in that so that i can understand this assignment better. i will also need to develop my coding skills to tackle this problem.

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? take it slowly work on the methods required and read the document and work accordingly. i will also not rush into things and try  to work at a pace so that i could finish early

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part? i will start with the well formed if there is one and start the methods accordingly, im assuming there is no wellformed we gave to implement so ill start with the methods and work from there

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties? yes, i was travelling over thanksgiving so it took me more time but i did eventually finish it. difficulty was there but i got it done

How did the plan go? it went well, i finished on time and felt like i understood the material

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment? nothing, i feel like ive been doing well on the others i just started late on this one so it took me longer. ill just go back to what i was doing before

Do I need more resources? no, i feel like we have enough resources and i used them to the best of my ability
