# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 3

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? Its similar to the last assignment, but this time its implementing iterations which have benefits that we can use but also drawbacks

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? i know how to use arrays and after looking at last homeworks solution, i sort of know how to do that. what i need to know is how to implement the iterations to work with my methods and how to do them to begin with.

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? take it in chunks, dont rush code, and USE THE HINTS.

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? i have good problem solving skills, im good at asking for help, and i enjoy struggling

What are some new skills I will need to develop? i will need to develop my thinking into code, i know what the error is most of the time i just dont know how to put it into code

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? start early, ive started early with this assignment so hopefully i find what i need help with early and get the help i need

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part? i will start with the required methods and work on the overrides after, as said in the homework pdf

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review
