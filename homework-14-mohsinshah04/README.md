# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 14

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? in this homework assignment, we are implementing a priority queue using a dynamic circular array

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? i know how to implement arrays as weve been working on this for a while, i also understand it fairly from class. what i need to know is how to implement the priority queue using a circular array, im going to need to learn the syntax for that and what a circular is as a whole

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? take it step by step and ask help when needed. ill also work in the tutoring center and ask for help when i get stuck, ill also ask questions on piazza when necessary

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? i have good critical thinking skills and i feel like i can understand the material with the current resources provided. im also great at asking questions so i will be asking questions to tutors and piazza when i get stuck.

What are some new skills I will need to develop? i will need to further develop my critical thinking skills so that i can understand and implement the PQ in a correct and efficient way

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? start early, dont wait until the last minute and ask questions when i get stuck, ive been doing a good job so far so i will keep that up. i will start with a wellformed if any as well as the unlock test and then work on the methods from there and complete each method step by step.

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part?  will start with a wellformed if any as well as the unlock test and then work on the methods from there and complete each method step by step. ill ask questions when i get stuck and after i finish, ill see if i can make it more efficient and less lines of code when i can.

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*
