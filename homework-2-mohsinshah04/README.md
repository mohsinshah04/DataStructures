# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 2

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? Dynamic arrays and using ADT sequence and find my way around Dynamic arrays, use cursore, and use sequence

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? Its similar to the last assignment regarding use of arrays and i know how arrays can have arrays inside of them but what i need to know is that its a different implementation of it and how removing or adding a point changes the array, even adding null

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? ask for help, take it one step at a time, and starting early, breaking it into chunks

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? i believe i have good problem solving skills, im confident in my ability to think

What are some new skills I will need to develop? i will need to develop a way to put my thoughts into code, i understand what i have to do i just need to know what code to write

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? give my 100%, ask good questions, and if needed ask for help

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part? i will do the wellFormed method as it seems to be the most important

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties? Yes, i feel that i have, i started early and got through some of the code even if it wasnt that much but i think im on the right track

How did the plan go? It went well, im almost complete with the wellFormed and i believe the rest isnt too complicated

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment? Go to tutoring, i went and i benefited immensely

Do I need more resources? maybe but i think that tutoring is very beneficial and if used correctly i could finish the assignment sooner

## Comments (optional)

Here are my comments on the assignment to the course instructors:
i collaborated with a few students and the tutor with the wellFormed but i dont recall their names
