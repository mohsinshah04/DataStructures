# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 12

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? this assignment is a follow up of the previous except its actually implementing a graph and using an HTML reader to implement a web crawler to perform breadth-first search over the web

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? i know the code that we are using from last week as i completed this assignment. what i need to know is how to search over the web using breadth first search so ill need to develop my knowledge further.

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? take it step by step, ask for help when needed, and try to start as early as possible which im doing now. ill also look into the resources provided and read the textbook to get a better understanding of the assignment and its contents.

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? i have good problem solving skills and i love to get work done, i enjoy the process, so i think if i set checkpoints for this assignment ill be able to finish on time if not early.

What are some new skills I will need to develop? i will need to further develop my coding skills so i could finish this assignment and get better and further in my field. i will also need to further develop my critical thinking skills so that i can understand the content and get better at thinking in general.

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? start early, ask questions when i get stuck, and work at the tutoring center so i have people that have already done the assignments help me out when i get stuck in real time.

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part? ive already completed the unlock test so i will start on a wellformed if there is one, ill then do it chunk by chunk until i finish this assignment. ill start with the methods and work from there.

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties? yes, i did. i finished fairly early and even though i was stuck i asked for advice when needed and finished the assignment

How did the plan go? the plan went well, there was no well formed so i hopped into crawl right away and finished that after struggle, but run was fairly simple it was about 4 lines but the struggle was in crawl but the plan went well overall

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment? i would say stay the same and start early so i could finish on time if not early, ill also be in the ssc so that i can get help when needed.

Do I need more resources? no, i feel like we have enough resources and i use them to the best of my ability and im completing the assignments which is a good thing

## Comments (optional)

Here are my comments on the assignment to the course instructors: i had to change the implementation to make it a URL que rather than a URLObject but im not sure why it didnt work when i had it as an object. my code is still the same as before but i just changed a few lines to convert it from a url to a urlObject
