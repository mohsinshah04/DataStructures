# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 10

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? this is similar to the last assignment with implementing a binary tree, but now the implementation is slightly different as we are using maps.

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? i know how to implement binary search trees as we have been working on them for the last 2 weeks. i also know how to add and remove from the bst as we did for the last assignments. i need to know how to implement maps and convert it to match the bst structure. im not sure how to do that yet as i havent done anything yet but im looking forward to it.

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? take it slow, make sure i understand the previous assignents so that the implementation isnt as hard for me. i will also go to the tutoring center and ask questions when needed, and make sure to attend office hours whenever possible.

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? i have good problem solving skills and i am good at creating examples to help me understand problems. im also good at asking questions, i will be attending tutoring center for sure and might attend office hours if i dont get the question answered.

What are some new skills I will need to develop? i will need to further develop my critical thinking skills and problem solving skills and also know how to use and implement maps.

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? the best way forward i see now is to take my time and ask questions when i need help, ill start as early as possible and make sure i understand every concept before i move on

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part? i will start the unlock test and do the readme and then start a well formed if there is any, an di will work from there. method by method.

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties? yes, it was an entirely new topic so i didnt know how to go about it but the oracle page i was guided to and the other resources such as the tutoring center helped me as well. i did start early though so i was able to finish early and complete the assignment early and i feel like if i didnt i would really struggle.

How did the plan go? the plan went well, took it step by step and used my resources to work on the assignment slowly and finished it on time. started slowly and finsihed it after alot of struggle.

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment? i will keep up the same work. ive heard from dr boyland that the assignment will be lighter as we have thanksgiving break but i will still start early and finish when i can

Do I need more resources? no i feel like i had plenty of resources so i didnt need more. this was a harder assignment so we had more resources so that was good.
