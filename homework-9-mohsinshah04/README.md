# CompSci 351 / CompSt 751 Homework Assignment 9

This is a homework assignment at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

## Planning: Due Friday 10pm

### Focus

What is this homework assignment about? Its similar to the previous assignment about binary search. The difference is that instead of a dynamic array you are using an iterator and linked list.

### Gather

What do I know?  What do I need to know that's new? i know how binary search trees work and how to add to them and also how to recursively use methods. what i need to know is how to implement it with an iterator and linked list and how to remove from the list in a bst

### Brainstorm

What are some ideas for solving this homework assignment? ideas are to take my time with the assignment and get pseudo code down so i can understand what the process is. i will also be in the tutoring center so i will ask for help when needed.

What are existing strengths I can bring to bear to solve the problems? i have good thinking skills that ive developed in this class so i can use those. im also decently good at writing pseudo code so i can write it out in parts and understand it from there and write my code down in an easier way 

What are some new skills I will need to develop? i will need to further develop my coding skills as  i am learning something new so i need to know how to implement it and actually write it down. i also need to be better at debugging so that i can find issues in my code and fix it whithout asking for help explaining what the debug issue is

### Evaluate

What is the best way forward that I can see now? start with the well formed and take it part by part and try to start as early as i can. i will also ask for help when needed and try to understand the concept better so that i can implement this outside of class

### Plan

What will I work on first after I finish this planning part? i will start the well formed and work from there. there are two well formed this time, including a second one for the iterator so ill work on the general one before i work on the iterator wellformed.

*The preceding steps should be completed and committed by the
Friday 10pm deadline.*

## Reflection: Due Monday 10pm

### Review

Did I correctly anticipate the difficulties? No, This assignment was harder for me, i assumed that it would be as easy as last weeks assignment but with linked lists and iterators it was harder. There were parts where i did anticipate the difficulties such as add as i did them already but i feel like i started early so it gave me more time to make mistakes and i eventually finished it.

How did the plan go? The plan went well, i finished the assignment early and felt like i started early as well so i had room to play with. It took along time but with the guidance of piazza and tutors, i got it. Also, asking friends for advice also helps me understand the assignment especially the parts of recursion.

### Preview

What should I do differently for next week's homework assignment? i would say do the same thing, start as soon as i can and go to the tutoring center when im stuck and ask piazza questions when necessary. i will also try to attend office hours to benefit more so i can ask 1 on 1 questions with Dr.Boyland.

Do I need more resources? No, i feel like i have alot of resources and i used them well and will continue to use them. i will also try to attend every lecture, unfortunately i missed the tuesday lecture because of some personal issue but i will try to attend the lectures this week.
